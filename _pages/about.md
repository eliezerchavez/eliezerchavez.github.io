> I am a Solutions Architect specializing in Cloud (Amazon Web Services & Azure), DevOps, CI/CD, SRE and IT Operations. Currently a Senior Project Manager and Expert Architect at [NTT DATA](https://emeal.usbranch.nttdata.com/). I am capable with a **wide** range of technical and big-picture architectural tasks.

### <span style="color:#4888bc">Want Me To Work With You?</span>
I am available to provide training and advisory support in the areas of architecture, cloud, and continuous delivery. I am also available to speak at both private and public events.

If you want to enquire as to my fees, availability, and get more information about the services I offer, then please [get in touch](/contact).

#### <span style="color:#4888bc">A little bit more about me. Like anyone cares.</span>

Love digging into customer problems and solve them with the latest technology available while create, scale, and optimize solutions that matter.

I have enjoyed many technical & executive positions throughout my career of more than 20 years as a Developer, Systems Administrator, Solutions Architect, Service Delivery Manager, Account Manager and more recently; Cloud Architect and DevOps Leader.

I like to believe that my personal and professional experiences have taught me the following:

* Team comes first, ALWAYS, after them;
* The Customer is the center of all.
* I stay calm when faced with adversity (well, most of the time) and finally;
* I am constantly learning because I never settle.
