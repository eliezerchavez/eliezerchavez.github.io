Welcome to **eliezerchavez**, my personal site and a tech blog focused in IT Architecture, Cloud & DevOps. I try my best to make sure that the discussions on my articles are troll, spam and abuse free but I'm not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here at **eliezerchavez**, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:

#### <span style="color:#4888bc">Be polite</span>
Don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you would say would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.
#### <span style="color:#4888bc">Don’t troll</span>
We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.
#### <span style="color:#4888bc">Spam? Goodbye</span>
We understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, however, we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or we’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.

To put it in a simple sentence, these guidelines boil down to “Don’t be a dick”. If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, I will not only remove the comment but  I'll may also ban you from participating in the discussions.

If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – I'll highly appreciate your support!

**Happy commenting!**
