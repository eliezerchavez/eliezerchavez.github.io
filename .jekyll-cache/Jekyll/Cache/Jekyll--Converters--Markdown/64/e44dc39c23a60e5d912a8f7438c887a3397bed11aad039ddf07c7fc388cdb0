I"2<p>Welcome to <strong>eliezerchavez</strong>, my personal site and a tech blog focused in IT Architecture, Cloud &amp; DevOps. I try my best to make sure that the discussions on my articles are troll, spam and abuse free but I’m not omnipresent. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with readers, writers and even for spawning stimulating conversation – it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you have a good time over here at <strong>eliezerchavez</strong>, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:</p>

<h4 id="be-polite"><span style="color:#4888bc">Be polite</span></h4>
<p>Don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you would say would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.</p>
<h4 id="dont-troll"><span style="color:#4888bc">Don’t troll</span></h4>
<p>We appreciate and welcome criticism towards writers here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting would be deleted without exception.</p>
<h4 id="spam-goodbye"><span style="color:#4888bc">Spam? Goodbye</span></h4>
<p>We understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, however, we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or we’ll give you a hand and show both you and your post the door.</p>

<p>To put it in a simple sentence, these guidelines boil down to “Don’t be a dick”. If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, I will not only remove the comment but  I’ll may also ban you from participating in the discussions.</p>

<p>If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’ – I’ll highly appreciate your support!</p>

<p><strong>Happy commenting!</strong></p>
